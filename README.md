ANME-SRB Metabolic Model (COPASI)
This repository contains COPASI files for simulating the energy metabolism of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The model integrates enzyme kinetics and thermodynamics to provide a mechanistic understanding of bioenergetics in syntrophic ANME-SRB interactions.
